## Usage

Once you've got the project running locally, you can easily customize it to fit your needs:

- **Update text**: Edit the `h1` and `p` tags in `index.html` to update the main message or add new text.
- **Change icons**: You can replace the `<i>` tag classes to use any icon from FontAwesome or NerdFonts. This is helpful for personalizing the design with your own style.
- **Modify the progress bar**: The progress bar's animation is controlled by the `script.js` file. By default, the bar increases by 10% every 2 seconds. You can adjust this value, or make the progress bar work based on real-time data, or modify it in any way you wish.
- **Style changes**: The project is fully customizable via CSS. You can edit `style.css` to change the background gradient, colors, fonts, and overall look of the page.
- **Additional functionality**: If you want to expand the project, feel free to add more features like countdown timers, additional animations, or other HTML5 elements to the page.

For more advanced customization, consider adjusting the background gradient, adding more animations, or integrating dynamic elements.
